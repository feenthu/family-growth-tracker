# Family Budget Tracker - localStorage to PostgreSQL Migration Progress

## Overview
The goal is to migrate the family-growth-tracker app from localStorage-only persistence to PostgreSQL-backed API persistence, enabling multi-device synchronization for household members.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Backend Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Complete Prisma schema with all required tables:
  - `Member`, `Bill`, `BillSplit`, `Payment`, `PaymentAllocation`
  - `RecurringBill`, `RecurringBillSplit`
  - `Mortgage`, `MortgageSplit`, `MortgagePayment`, `MortgagePaymentAllocation`, `MortgagePaymentBreakdown`
  - `Setting` for app configuration
- **Express API Server**: Full REST API with CRUD endpoints for all entities
- **Railway Deployment**: Successfully deployed to `https://family-growth-tracker-production.up.railway.app/`
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Enterprise-grade GitHub Actions with testing, security scanning, and deployment

### 2. API Service Layer (COMPLETED)
- **`utils/api.ts`**: Complete API client with TypeScript interfaces
  - All interfaces match Prisma schema (ApiMember, ApiBill, ApiPayment, etc.)
  - ApiClient class with methods for all CRUD operations
  - Proper error handling and type safety
  - Configured for both development (localhost:8080) and production (Railway URL)

### 3. Current State Analysis (COMPLETED)
- **localStorage Usage Identified**: App currently uses `useLocalStorage` hook for:
  - `people` (Person[]) - Family members
  - `bills` (Bill[]) - One-time bills
  - `recurringBills` (RecurringBill[]) - Template bills
  - `payments` (Payment[]) - Bill payments
  - `mortgages` (Mortgage[]) - Mortgage loans
  - `mortgagePayments` (MortgagePayment[]) - Mortgage payments
  - `mortgagePaymentBreakdowns` (MortgagePaymentBreakdown[]) - Payment details

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed Work

### 4. API-Based Hooks (COMPLETED)
‚úÖ **`hooks/useApiData.ts`**: Complete API hooks implementation:
- `useMembers()` - Replaces `useLocalStorage<Person[]>`
- `useBills()` - Replaces `useLocalStorage<Bill[]>`
- `useRecurringBills()` - Replaces `useLocalStorage<RecurringBill[]>`
- `usePayments()` - Replaces `useLocalStorage<Payment[]>`
- `useMortgages()` - Replaces `useLocalStorage<Mortgage[]>`
- `useMortgagePayments()` - Replaces `useLocalStorage<MortgagePayment[]>`
- `useMortgagePaymentBreakdowns()` - Handles payment breakdown data
- **Returns**: `[data, setData, loading, error]` for each hook

### 5. Data Type Mapping (COMPLETED)
‚úÖ **Complete type conversion system**:
- Bidirectional mapping between frontend and API types
- Money conversion: `amount` ‚Üî `amountCents` (cents-based storage)
- Field name mapping: `payerPersonId` ‚Üî `payerMemberId`, etc.
- Split data structure conversion with proper error handling

### 6. Component Updates (COMPLETED)
‚úÖ **`App.tsx` fully updated**:
- All `useLocalStorage` calls replaced with API hooks
- All CRUD handlers now use `apiOperations` for server persistence
- Async/await pattern implemented throughout
- Data migration effects removed (handled server-side now)

### 7. Loading States & Error Handling (COMPLETED)
‚úÖ **Complete UX improvements**:
- `LoadingSpinner` component with multiple sizes
- `ErrorMessage` component with retry functionality
- Centralized loading state management
- Error state display with user-friendly messages
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable

## üìã Remaining Work

### 1. Data Migration Strategy
- Initial one-time sync from localStorage to PostgreSQL for existing users
- Backup/export functionality for user data
- Import functionality for migrating existing data

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Offline functionality and sync when reconnected
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Better error messaging for specific API failures

### 3. Real-time Features (Optional)
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Multi-device synchronization notifications
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Data caching strategies
- Pagination for large datasets
- Debounced API calls for rapid changes
- Background sync for better responsiveness

### 5. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Unit tests for API hooks and type conversions
- Integration tests with mock API responses
- End-to-end testing of CRUD operations
- Load testing for concurrent user scenarios

### 6. Production Deployment Verification
- Verify Railway deployment with new API integration
- Database migration for existing production data
- Performance monitoring and error tracking
- User acceptance testing

## üéØ Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Test the new API integration locally** - Verify all CRUD operations work
2. **Create data migration utility** - Help existing users move from localStorage to API
3. **Deploy and test on Railway** - Verify production deployment works
4. **Multi-device testing** - Test synchronization across different browsers/devices
5. **Performance testing and optimization** - Ensure the app performs well with API calls

## üîß Technical Notes

### API Base URL Configuration
- Development: `http://localhost:8080`
- Production: `https://family-growth-tracker-production.up.railway.app`

### Data Structure Differences
- **Money**: Frontend uses `number`, API uses `amountCents: number`
- **IDs**: Both use `string` but API may have different generation
- **Dates**: Frontend uses ISO strings, API expects Date objects in some cases

### Error Handling Strategy
- Network errors: Show retry UI
- Validation errors: Show field-specific messages
- Server errors: Show generic error with support contact
